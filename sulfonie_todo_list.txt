ToDo List for Sulfonie:

- implement Auto-fertilization as for N fertilization (currently only works with fixed dates in fert_x.txt and irr_x.txt files)
(requires a rework of automan.txt file and how it is read, may cause compatibility issues with older versions)
- implement a S as a stress factor in the model (requires research on the topic)
- S content values for crops in relation to dry bio mass, during development stages, to correctly calculate S residue after harvest
- find out if S/N Ratio is a good indicator for S stress in crops 
- find out Smin wash out of the model is realistic (requires research on the topic/field data)
